This folder contains an implementation of the Probabilistic Differential Equation Solver (uqdes) for solving delay differential equations and incorporating the probabilistic solution into an MCMC algorithm for inference on the JAK-STAT system. Open JAKSTAT_inference.m for details. 

This method is described in the paper Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Differential Equations, by O.A. Chkrebtii, D.A. Campbell, M.A. Girolami, B. Calderhead.
